Excercise 1: What does a streak length of 1 mean, i.e. how many hits and misses are in a streak of 1? What about a streak length of 0?

A streak length of 1 mean player hit the basket once, then missed the basket once. A streak length of 0 mean 0 hit, 1 miss. 



Excercise 2: Describe the distribution of Kobe's streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals. What was his typical streak length? How long was his longest streak of baskets?

This is basically a graph that is skewed to the right, with the medium value located on the left side of the mean value. The most typical streak length is 0, and his longest streak of baskets is 4. 



Excercise 3: In your simulation of flipping the unfair coin 100 times, how many flips came up heads?

19 heads

```{r}
sim_unfair_coin <- sample(outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8))

sim_unfair_coin
table(sim_unfair_coin)

```

Excercise 4: What change needs to be made to the sample function so that it reflects a shooting percentage of 45%? Make this adjustment, then run a simulation to sample 133 shots. Assign the output of this simulation to a new object called sim_basket.

```{r}
set.seed(10);
outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(outcomes, size = 133, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.45, 0.55))
table(sim_basket)

```

Comparing Kobe Bryant to the Independent Shooter
Using calc_streak, compute the streak lengths of sim_basket.

1. Describe the distribution of streak lengths. What is the typical streak length for this simulated independent shooter with a 45% shooting percentage? How long is the player's longest streak of baskets in 133 shots?

The range of this distribution is from 0 to 4. The graph is skewed to the right, with 0 being the typical streak length for this simulated independent shooter. The longest streak of baskets in 133 shots is 4. 

```{r}
kobe_streak <- calc_streak(kobe$basket)
barplot(table(kobe_streak))


sim_basket <- calc_streak(sim_basket)
barplot(table(sim_basket))

```


2. If you were to run the simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how would you expect its streak distribution to compare to the distribution from the question above? Exactly the same? Somewhat similar? Totally different? Explain your reasoning.

Somewhat similar. Because the probability of hitting and missing the basket stay the same: 45% and 55%. Based on the law of large numbers, when number of trials approches infinity, the probability should approach 45% and 55%. However, for experiemnt that only has 133 trials, the occurences of each elements in the sample space does vary each time most likely. So that new simulation will be somehow similar to the old one, but to be exatly the same, it will be very unlikely. 


3. How does Kobe Bryant's distribution of streak lengths compare to the distribution of streak lengths for the simulated shooter? Using this comparison, do you have evidence that the hot hand model fits Kobe's shooting patterns? Explain.

Very very similar. The graph are both skewed to the right. If Kobe has a hot hand, the skewedness of his graph will decrease to have more and longer streaks. However, from the barplot, the graph is not showing the evidence.
